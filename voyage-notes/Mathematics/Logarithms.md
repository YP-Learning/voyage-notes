-   The **pH** scale in chemistry is _logarithmic_.
-   The **Richter Scale** used to measure earthquake is _logarithmic_.
-   The economy is also measured on a _logarithmic_ scale.

[This video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-exp-and-log/alg-logarithmic-scale/v/vi-and-sal-explore-how-we-think-about-scale) by Khan academy explains the logarithmic scale.

## What is it?
basically its just another way of writting exponents, in exponents the output is the value after applying the exponent, but here the output is the exponent itself.
#### $\log_{base}(number) = exponent \iff base^{exponent} = number$
