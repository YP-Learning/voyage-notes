## The Product Rule
##### $\log_{a}(b) + \log_{a}(c) = \log_{a}(b*c)$

## The Quotient Rule
##### $\log_{a}(b) - \log_{a}(c) = \log_{a}(\frac{b}{c})$

## The Power Rule
##### $a \cdot \log_b(c) = \log_b(c^a)$

## The Change of Base Rule
##### $\log_b(a) = \frac{\log_c(a)}{\log_c(b)}$

## The Reciprocal Rule
##### $\log_a(b) = \frac{1}{\log_b(a)}$
